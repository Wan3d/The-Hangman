                There is a man that his life depends on you... How can you help him?
                Every match there will be a random word generated that you have to guess.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                You will be asked for an input and you have to input any letter, no characters or numbers.
                If the letter you choose is in the hidden word, you're going to see it.
                Either way, you will lose a life for each error!
                You only have 6 lifes, so you better think about your answers
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Have fun!</p>
